    I named my wallet.dat -> ARGO-wallet.dat because ARGO is not my only wallet backup file.
    Now your ARGO-wallet.dat is saved on your local disk in C:\Backup (my choosed file location for this guide) folder and my recommendation to you is: **Save every wallet backup on USB-Stick additionally!**
