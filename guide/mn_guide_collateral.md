## Collateral
To run a masternode, you need to send 10000 ARGO coins to a new generated wallet.

1. To generate a new wallet address, open your wallet and goto **File** -> **Receiving addresses...**

    a new window will open, click on button **New**

    enter a label for your new wallet (I use mn0X for my masternode wallets) and click on button **OK**

    <img src="https://node-support.network/coins/argo/mn-guide/collateral/3.png">

    now you see your new generated wallet address in **Receiving addresses** overview

    copy the wallet address to go forward to next step

2. Send 10000 ARGO coins to new wallet address

    Open tab **Send**, enter your new created wallet address in field **Pay To:**, the amount of 10000 ARGO coins in field **Amount** and    hit the button **Send**

    a new window opens to enter your wallet password
    
    <img src="https://node-support.network/coins/argo/mn-guide/collateral/6.png">
    
    after entering your wallet password you will be asked if you confirm to send your coins

    after you confirmend you can you your transaction in your main wallet window.

    Now you need to wait for 15 confirmations to get your collateral tx & collateral txid.\
    **After 15 confirmations**, open debug console (goto **Tools** -> **Debug console**) and enter
    
    `masternode outputs`
    
    you will see your collateral tx/txid output, like:
    
    `"6aefa62c1bebd5248a873535e66544b3f4d850fb4cf1f6fa7f2747c95c37c4d9": "1"`
    
    which you need for your masternode.conf (will be needed later for wallet configuration)
